            <p class="hidden-text">I have the soul of an old man trapped in a young body, complete with a love for naps and complaining about "kids these days." My fitness journey consists of carrying all the grocery bags in one trip and occasionally doing a push-up to see if I still can. I aspire to be the kind of person my WiFi thinks I am when it asks, "Are you a robot?". efficient, intelligent, and slightly terrifying. But in reality, Iâ€™m just here, winging it like the rest of us.</p>

            <p class="textinside">Hello there! I am Swornim, a very advanced lifeform who specializes in procrastination, overthinking, and cooking meals 1 hr after having dinner. My hobbies include pressing the wrong strings on my guitar and pretending its correct, pretending to understand complex topics five minutes after learning about them, and having existential randomly at 3am after I wake up from my 2 hr slumber.</p><br><br>
