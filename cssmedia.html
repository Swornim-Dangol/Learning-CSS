            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;">These are some or the artworks I made during and after the pandemic. I used to be so opitmistic while doing artworks. I drew everyday for almost a year during pandemic and learned alot of new things about art. I wish I had continued this possibly even as a career but I had to let it go because of some things. But I am still proud of what I made back then I still make some artworks once or twice a year to re-live and re-experience my love for drawing</p>
